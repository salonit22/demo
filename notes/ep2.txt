NPM - is everything but not node package manager (Hahaa) ❤️ 
NPM dose not have a full form - it manages package but it dose not standard for node package manager
its a standard package manager, huge package manager every package is added over here

PACKAGE.json - configuration for NPM
npm will take care the version of the package 

 DEV dependency - developement phase 
 normal dependency is used in production also 

 parceler is junkies not used in production so we can download as dev dependency
 npm install -D parcel

 caret and tilde in package.jason (^ ~ major.patch.minor)
 these two are used to sepiciy the versions for the dependency and control how updateds are handled
 caret allows patch and minor updateds
 tilde allows minor updated only 

 package.json & package.lock.json 
 it keeps track of all the dependency exact dependency that is used
 intergrity : its a hash file which checks the code in development and in production

 .gitignore 
 node modules has lot of changes all those changes are not need to pushed into gitignore
 /node_module will ignore this 
if have package.json and package.lock.json we can regenerate it - npm install

------------------------------ PART 2 ----------------------------------------------------
npx parcel index.html 
when we do npm we are just calling the command of npm
npx means excuting a package 

we have to make the file as type = 'module' to get rid of this error
import react and react dom 
parcel automatically reloads the browser
parcel.cache will keep the file, so inital build will take more time compared to next builds
- dev build
- local server 
- HMR hot module replacement 
- File watching algorithm - written in cpp
- caching - faster build 
- Image optimization
- bundling
- Minification
- compress 
- code splitting 
- consisten hashing
- differential bundiling
- Error handling
-HTTPs
- Tree shaking - remove unused code 
- create different build for dev and production (npx parcel build index.html)
