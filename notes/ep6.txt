Monolith architecture
 API, UI,AUTH,DB,SMS service in same project
 if any change to one part we have to build the whole project , bulk project

Microservice architecture
 we have different services for different jobs
 API service, UI service, AUTH service, Email notification service, DB service
 these are micro service combines to form big app
 they talk to each other based on use case 
 SEPERATION OF CONSENT - It follows single responsibilty principle 
 In project backend is working seperatly, UI is working seperatly they sepratly have ther builds

 How do these service intract each other?
 all the service have different ports and deployed in the same domain name 

 Api rendering approach 
 loads - > api - > render 
 loads - > inital render - > api - > render  (better approch )
this take the less amount of time to render the page and it loads the data as fast 

UseEffect 
It is a callback function which take two args 
it is called after the component is rendred

SHIMMER UI 
if the API is taking some time load shimmer ui after load it with actual data
- optional chaning 
- conditional rendering
